	<p>The complicit newspapers and cable news channels<strong>&nbsp;publish polls showing Joe Biden leading in several swing states, even if it's not true.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Facebook and Twitter amplify expectations of a Biden victory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>This sets the stage for a furor when it turns out that he loses on election night.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>On cue,&nbsp;<strong>Antifa commences to riot all around the country.</strong>&nbsp;Meanwhile, a mighty harvest of mail-in votes pours into election districts utterly unequipped to validate them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Lawfare cadres agitate in the contested states' legislatures to send rogue elector slates to the electoral college. The dispute ends up in congress, which awaits a seating of newly-elected representatives on January 4, hopefully for Lawfare, mostly Democrats. Whoops…!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Turns out, the Dems lost their majority there too.&nbsp;<strong>Fighting in the streets ramps up and overwhelms hamstrung police forces</strong>&nbsp;in Democratic-run cities.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>January 20 — Inauguration Day — rolls around, and the&nbsp;<strong>Dems ask the military to drag Trump out of the White House</strong>&nbsp;"with great dispatch!" as Mr. Biden himself put it so nicely back in the summer.</p>
